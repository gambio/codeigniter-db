# CodeIgniterDB Adapter
###### CodeIgniterDB adapter so that you can use the database object with composer in external applications.

#### Introduction

This composer package provides an adapter for using the build-in CodeIgniter database object within another application. The original problem is that the database library is strictly binded with the rest of the framework and it is not possible to use it without some modifications. So what this package does is to create a fake CodeIgniter environment so that the library works as expected.
